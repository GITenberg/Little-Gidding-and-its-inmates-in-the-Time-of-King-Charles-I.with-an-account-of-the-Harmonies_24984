<p>&ldquo;How happy a king were I, if I had many more such
workmen and workwomen in my kingdom!&nbsp; Their art and ability
is excellent.&nbsp; Let them know I will not forget them.&nbsp;
God&rsquo;s blessing on their hearts, and painful
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the words and opinions of King Charles I., when
speaking of the happy and industrious family whose life and
labours at Little Gidding are described in the following pages, a
family entirely devoted to good works, under the <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>able direction
of Mr. Nicholas Ferrar, whose history has happily been preserved
for us with great accuracy, and which can hardly fail to be
attractive.</p>
<p>Although Nicholas Ferrar and Little Gidding are names that are
invariably associated with one another, it must not be imagined
that he spent his whole life there.&nbsp; It was not, indeed,
till he was thirty-three years old that he left the busy and
stirring scenes for which he seemed so suited; and before
describing the twelve years of seclusion with which he ended his
life, it is necessary to say something about his more active
employments as a young man.&nbsp; They prove beyond doubt that he
was endued with abilities of the highest order, which might have
led him to positions of great public importance had his
inclinations so prompted him.</p>
<p>Nicholas Ferrar was born in the year 1592, his parents being
conspicuous for their piety and charity, their conscientious
discharge of every duty, and their careful training of a numerous
family in every point of virtue and religion, special attention
being paid to the study of the Bible, large portions of which
were committed to memory.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferrar was a merchant, connected with all <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the great
centres of commerce, especially with the East and West Indies;
and being given to most generous hospitality, he was on friendly
terms with many persons of eminence, such as Drake, Raleigh, and
Hawkins.</p>
<p>Nicholas was the third son, and his talents began to develop
themselves very early.&nbsp; His memory, which was naturally very
retentive, was carefully cultivated, and he was at all times
eager and diligent in his studies.&nbsp; At the age of fourteen
he was admitted to Clare Hall, Cambridge; four years later he
took his degree, and was before long elected to a
Fellowship.&nbsp; But his health now broke down, and it was
considered that the only chance of his recovery lay in a complete
change, and in leaving England.&nbsp; Just at this time the
Princess Elizabeth was starting for the Palatinate, after her
marriage with the Elector Frederick, and Ferrar was fortunate in
obtaining permission to be included in her suite.&nbsp; They
first went to Holland, but before long Ferrar left the Royal
party, as he had resolved on seeing some places not included in
the Royal programme.</p>
<p>We must, however, hurry over this part of Ferrar&rsquo;s life,
very interesting as it is, and it must suffice to say that in the
course of five years he <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>visited many parts of Germany and
Italy, then went to the south of France, by sea to Spain, where
he had several startling adventures, and after travelling five
hundred miles alone, and on foot, reached Saint Sebastian, from
which port he took ship to England.</p>
<p>The advantage of these travels to Ferrar was great in many
ways.&nbsp; He thoroughly mastered the languages of the various
countries; he studied closely their forms of government, trade,
and commerce, and acquired an insight even into the handicrafts
of the people.&nbsp; He made himself acquainted with the
doctrines and discipline of the Churches and religious sects, and
procured, whenever he could do so, the assistance of the ablest
scholars to instruct him.&nbsp; Being well supplied with money by
his father, he was enabled to collect, besides other things, a
great number of prints and engravings by all the best masters; in
fact, it is stated that he let nothing of this sort escape him
that was valuable; and being all relative to, or illustrative of,
passages in the Bible, they were utilized to great advantage when
in his later years he compiled &ldquo;The Harmonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his return home, his natural inclination was to settle at
Cambridge and resume his work at <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Clare Hall;
but, partly owing to his father&rsquo;s advanced age, and partly
on account of his elder brother having important work in London
in connection with the Virginia Plantation Company, Nicholas
Ferrar determined to settle there with them.&nbsp; Here he soon
attracted much attention for his many eminent qualities, reports
of which had, indeed, been received from abroad, and before long
Sir Edwyn Sandys and Lord Southampton, both of them governors of
the Virginia Company, having discovered for themselves his great
worth, proposed him as King&rsquo;s Counsel for the
Plantation.&nbsp; He thus became deeply engaged in public
business; and as his work was continually produced in open court,
his reputation increased more and more.&nbsp; Two or three years
later his powers were still further tested, for the Spanish party
exerted all their influence to overthrow the Company; and as
Nicholas Ferrar was at this time the deputy-governor, the chief
burden of the defence fell on his shoulders.&nbsp; His efforts
were, however, all in vain, and before long the patent or charter
was withdrawn, and the Company was dissolved, owing to the false
accusations brought against the managers and directors.</p>
<p>Ferrar was now elected Member of Parliament, <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and was able
to bring before the House and the public more fully the iniquity
of these proceedings, and by his skilful management cleared the
directors, and brought their opponents to justice and
punishment.</p>
<p>This was the concluding act of Ferrar&rsquo;s public life, and
we shall now turn to a scene of a vastly different nature.&nbsp;
But it has been necessary to say thus much to exhibit in its true
light the force of character, the wonderful diligence and
activity of the man, who (as we shall now see) decided on
devoting the rest of his life to religious exercises, to works of
charity and usefulness, but living apart and without interruption
from the busy world.</p>
<p>There is evidence to show that this had long been his wish, in
fact, that from his earliest years some such ideas had been in
his mind; but until now he had not seen his way to carry them
out.</p>
<p>The first and most necessary step was to find a place suitable
for his purpose, and hearing that the lordship of Little Gidding
was for sale, he went to inspect it.</p>
<p>It was in an obscure part of the county of Huntingdon, a large
manor house and a cottage for shepherds the only buildings, with
the exception <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of a dilapidated church used as a
barn.&nbsp; The air was healthy, and the whole estate lay in
pasture.</p>
<p>The spot seemed admirably adapted to his designs, and was
accordingly bought; and after settling his own business and also
his brother&rsquo;s, he moved to Little Gidding in the year
1625.</p>
<p>He now gathered round him a very large family party.&nbsp; His
father was dead, but his mother, his brother, and his sister, who
was married to a Mr. Collett, with the children of both families,
all joined under the one roof.&nbsp; When the establishment was
completed and in proper working order, it is said that they
numbered forty persons, including schoolmasters and servants.</p>
<p>The meeting between Nicholas Ferrar and his mother, who was
now 73 years old, is so characteristic that it must be
related.&nbsp; Within three or four days of his arrival, and
before the necessary repairs had been carried out, Mrs. Ferrar
rides to Gidding from her daughter&rsquo;s home, no great
distance off.&nbsp; Nicholas Ferrar meets her outside the manor
house, and kneeling on the ground, asks and receives her
blessing.&nbsp; He then entreats her to enter his dwelling and
repose herself after the journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;yonder I see the
church, let us first go there and give thanks to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>She is told she cannot even get inside the door, for
there had been no time as yet to clear out the hay which was in
it.&nbsp; But she persists in her resolve, and thrusting herself
in a little way, she kneels and prays.&nbsp; Then sending for the
workmen employed in the house, the hay is flung out of the
windows, and the church is cleansed as well as might be for the
present, and till this is done she will not set foot in her new
home.</p>
<p>The following year, 1626, Nicholas Ferrar returned to London
for a short while to dispose of his house and bid good-bye to his
friends.&nbsp; He now was able to carry out a resolution, which
it is believed he had made long before, and was ordained Deacon
by Dr. Laud, the future Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; Many
people imagined that this was to enable him to seek
ecclesiastical preferments, and several valuable livings were
soon offered to him; but his sole object was that he might have
the necessary authority to carry on the spiritual work of his own
home, and thus be of greater use to his family.</p>
<p>He had doubtless by now worked out the general plan of life,
and put his house and the church into proper order.&nbsp; Certain
glebe lands and tithes which had been alienated from their <!--
page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>rightful owners were restored; and to prove the honesty
of his purpose he even pulled down a very large dovecote upon the
premises, which contained a great number of pigeons.&nbsp; The
reason for this was that all his property was laid out as
pasture, and therefore the pigeons fed on his neighbours&rsquo;
corn-fields.&nbsp; In the place of the dovecote he made a
school-house, and permission was given to the people of the towns
and villages within reach to send their children to be instructed
under his supervision, and without payment or expense.&nbsp; For
this purpose he provided three resident masters; one was to teach
English to the poor children and Latin to his nephews and nieces,
another superintended the writing and arithmetic, while the third
was for instruction in the theory and practice of music.</p>
<p>There was also especial inducement held out to all children of
the neighbourhood to learn the Psalms by heart.&nbsp; Each one
was given a Psalter, and had to go to Gidding on Sunday mornings
to repeat his portion learnt during the week.&nbsp; There were
sometimes more than a hundred children, and they were given a
penny for each Psalm learnt, and a dinner served in the great
hall.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>It will be as well now to describe in detail the
&ldquo;particular and more punctual actions of each day in the
week,&rdquo; which we get with great exactness from the records
left us by John Ferrar.&nbsp; To begin with Sunday&mdash;early
rising was encouraged on this day, as throughout the week,
namely, five o&rsquo;clock in winter and four o&rsquo;clock in
summer.&nbsp; The younger children first assembled in the great
hall, where was always a good warm fire in the winter.&nbsp; Here
they found Nicholas Ferrar awaiting them, to whom they repeated
such chapters or Psalms as they had been given to learn.&nbsp;
After this they returned to their rooms to make themselves
&ldquo;more comely in their best attires.&rdquo;&nbsp; Breakfast,
and private reading or conversation in their own rooms, went on
till nine o&rsquo;clock, when the bell called them together
again.&nbsp; They all met in the great hall, and, having sung a
hymn, proceeded in decent order to the church.</p>
<p>The three schoolmasters led the way, wearing their black
gowns, the youths (also in gowns) following two and two, John
Ferrar and Mr. Collett came next, and then Nicholas Ferrar
leading his aged mother; immediately behind her came Mrs. Collett
and the daughters, and the procession closed with all the
servants.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Each as they came into church made a low obeisance, and
took up their allotted places; Nicholas Ferrar, in surplice and
hood, saying the service.&nbsp; This over, the &ldquo;Psalm
children&rdquo; went to the manor house and repeated their
Psalms.</p>
<p>At half-past ten they went to the church again, when the
minister of the neighbouring parish came for the Communion
Service and to preach.&nbsp; That done, dinner was served in the
house, first for the &ldquo;Psalm children&rdquo;&mdash;old Mrs.
Ferrar herself very often bringing in the first dish&mdash;and
afterwards for the rest of the family.</p>
<p>Recreation or walking in the garden was permitted till two
o&rsquo;clock, when the bell called them together again for
evening service at the nearest parish church.&nbsp; Supper-time
was five or six o&rsquo;clock, and while it was being prepared
the organ was played in the great hall and an anthem was
sung.&nbsp; After supper each one could occupy himself as he
wished, indoors or walking abroad, or &ldquo;passing the time
with good discourse.&rdquo;&nbsp; At eight o&rsquo;clock there
was more singing to the organ, followed by prayers, and then the
children, after asking the &ldquo;old gentlewoman&rsquo;s&rdquo;
blessing, all bid each good night.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferrar also made it his special care that no <!-- page
16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>work
in the house should prevent the servants attending church; there
were none left behind; and on the Sundays when the Holy Communion
was administered, &ldquo;the servants that had feasted with them
in the church were not thought unworthy to eat with them in the
parlour,&rdquo; sitting at the end of the same table.</p>
<p>It would be tedious and uninteresting to attempt to follow the
week-day employments in the exact order in which they were
carried out, but the general plan may be given with advantage, as
illustrating the principles inculcated at Gidding.</p>
<p>The day began early&mdash;at four or five
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;by the children repeating to Mr. Ferrar what
they had learnt by heart the day before.&nbsp; At six
o&rsquo;clock the recitation of the Psalms began, and it was so
planned that &ldquo;certain members of the family repeated
certain Psalms at every hour of the day, every one knowing his
turn and hour of attendance; and thus, without undue interruption
of other work, the whole book of Psalms was repeated once in the
twenty-four hours.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition to this, the children
had to say one of the chapters of the Concordance, or Harmony of
the Four Evangelists, which was arranged purposely by <!-- page
17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Nicholas Ferrar, so that it might be gone through once
in every month.</p>
<p>Three times during the day the bell rang to summon them for a
short service in the church, on each occasion the proceeding
being as described for Sunday.</p>
<p>Every hour of the day had some special employment, some of the
children sitting in the great hall watched by Mrs. Ferrar, some
in the new school-house with the masters.&nbsp; Their occupations
were as varied as possible: English, Latin, and other languages,
writing and ciphering, and learning by heart being interspersed
with singing, playing the organ, and other instruments, making
the Concordances, bookbinding and gilding, and embroidery.&nbsp;
At stated times the boys were encouraged in active outdoor
exercises, running, leaping, and archery.&nbsp; As the girls grew
up they were made to perfect themselves in good
housewifery.&nbsp; A month at a time each one had control of the
housekeeping, all expenditure being carefully booked; at the end
of the month her accounts were looked over, and her duties handed
on to the next in rotation.</p>
<p>A room was set apart as an infirmary for any member of the
family who might require nursing, <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and another
room for the reception of any poor person who might be brought in
sick or hurt.&nbsp; The ladies were taught to dress their wounds,
and to do all things necessary for their relief, but the
prescribing of medicines Mr. Ferrar kept for himself, as he had
many years studied this science.&nbsp; They distilled
&ldquo;cordial waters,&rdquo; and kept in the dispensary a good
supply of balsams, oils, and all things needful for the cure of
their patients.</p>
<p>At meal times the custom prevailed of reading aloud, the
person whose turn it might be, first having some light food, and
after the reading was finished, &ldquo;in regard of his
forbearance, always having the advantage of some more food than
his fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reading was to be something &ldquo;delightful and easy,
such as stories of sea voyages, descriptions of foreign
countries, their rise and fall, and illustrated by the particular
actions of eminent persons.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in order that these
stories might not be forgotten, it was further arranged that
notes (or &ldquo;a summary collection&rdquo;) should be taken of
everything worthy of attention, and that these notes should
afterwards be transcribed, and put into language fitted to the
capacity of the children, who then had, in turn, to recite the
stories.&nbsp; This <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>practice brought the boys into a
habit of delivering any speech with assurance and good manner,
and of expressing themselves in a becoming and elegant style.</p>
<p>They also became thoroughly acquainted with ancient and modern
history, and knew and understood the great affairs of life better
than many who lived more in the world.</p>
<p>Analogous to this, and no doubt a development of it, were
&ldquo;The maiden-sisters exercises.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were
conversations or dialogues recited by the Miss Colletts,
illustrative of some special virtue, and always enforced by
examples taken from history.</p>
<p>The sisters, for this purpose, were known by such titles as
The Patient, The Cheerful, The Affectionate, etc., and formed
themselves into what they called &ldquo;The Little
Academy,&rdquo; of which Mary Collett was &ldquo;The
Chief,&rdquo; Mrs. Collett was called &ldquo;The
Moderator,&rdquo; John Ferrar &ldquo;The Guardian,&rdquo; and
Nicholas Ferrar &ldquo;The Visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subjects and the substance of the exercises were supplied
by Nicholas Ferrar himself, but the sisters were left to compile
them in their own words.&nbsp; They were prepared some time
beforehand, and after they had been recited were transcribed into
books kept for the purpose.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Four folio volumes of these &ldquo;conversations&rdquo;
are still in existence, and are, no doubt, in the handwriting of
Mary and Ann Collett.&nbsp; They are bound in black leather,
stamped with gilt lines, and with gilt edges, and have been
passed on from one member of the family to another to the present
owner, a Mr. Mapletoft Davis, living in Australia. <a
name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20"
class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p>Some idea of the general plan of these &ldquo;exercises&rdquo;
may be gathered from the following notes taken from the
manuscripts.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the &ldquo;Little Academy&rdquo; was on
Ash Wednesday, 1630, when the subject was &ldquo;The Folly of
Delaying Repentance.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next meeting was on Easter
Monday, a speech being made on &ldquo;Happiness,&rdquo;
illustrated by stories of King Philip of Spain, King Henry IV. of
France, and Popes Marcellus and Adrian.&nbsp; On other occasions
the following subjects were selected: &ldquo;Humility towards
God, and moderation to equals and enemies is most
beneficial,&rdquo; illustrated by stories of Charles V.;
&ldquo;We must overcome evil with good,&rdquo; illustration, John
of Alexandria, etc., etc.</p>
<p>At first it seems that the recitations were given on five
festivals, which days naturally provided <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>suitable
subjects, and afterwards it was decided to increase the number to
twelve days, and they pass the following resolution: &ldquo;Every
day must handle a new matter, that&rsquo;s the injunction; and
because the days afford not any special occasion, the particular
names imposed on us shall be the subjects successively of our
several exercises.&rdquo;&nbsp; The titles were (1) &ldquo;The
Chief&rdquo; (who chose for her subject &ldquo;Humility&rdquo;);
(2) The Patient; (3) The Affectionate; (4) The Cheerful; (5) The
Submiss; (6) The Obedient; (7) The Moderate.&nbsp; Generally the
conversations were enlivened by music and singing, but when the
subject was &ldquo;Patience&rdquo; this was omitted, and there
was much less anecdote.&nbsp; The discourse was also somewhat
longer, so that the virtue which was being illustrated was at the
same time practically enforced.&nbsp; It is not quite clear how
long the exercises were continued, but in the second volume of
the manuscripts it is stated that many home troubles had helped
to break up the &ldquo;Little Academy,&rdquo; especially old Mrs.
Ferrar&rsquo;s death, which was in the year 1634, and that the
actors were reduced to three, when their cousin, young Nicholas
Ferrar, &ldquo;took upon himself to revive their antient
practises.&rdquo;&nbsp; But after this the actors all appear with
fresh names.</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>Not content with the most careful and minute regulations
for the employment of every hour of the day in some secular or
religious matter, (for we read that &ldquo;every hour had its
company for the performance of some special duty,&rdquo;)
Nicholas Ferrar further arranged that those so inclined should
pursue their devotional exercises also at night.&nbsp; Two were
to watch together in a room set apart for the purpose; the
womankind had a room at one side of the house, and the men had
one on the other side.&nbsp; The watching lasted from 9 p.m. till
1 a.m., and during those four hours the whole of the Book of
Psalms was said over carefully, verse by verse, alternately.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferrar himself generally watched twice in the week, the
others never more than once; and in the winter special
precautions were taken to prevent them suffering from cold.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock, when the watch was finished, they lay
down till six o&rsquo;clock, but did not actually go to bed at
all, as on other nights.</p>
<p>It was apparently some account of the &ldquo;Harmonies of the
Four Evangelists&rdquo; which first attracted King Charles&rsquo;
attention to the family living at Gidding, and about the year
1631, being not far off with his Court, he sent a gentleman to
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>ask for the loan of the book.&nbsp; This was conceded
with some hesitation, and the King, having once got it into his
hands, would not part with it again, until he had obtained a
promise that another similar volume should be made for him.&nbsp;
The work was promptly executed, and may now be seen in the
British Museum.</p>
<p>The careful study of the Harmonies or Concordances is most
interesting, and even in these modern times one at least is used
daily as a means of instruction for the children of the family
where the book has an honoured home, in much the same manner as
the children at Little Gidding used it two hundred and fifty
years ago.</p>
<p>No more need be said about the Harmonies here, as a full
account of the manner of their construction and the history and
resting-place of all the specimens that can be heard of at the
present time will be related in another chapter.</p>
<p>But in close connection with the making of the Concordances
must be mentioned the art of bookbinding, and embroidered covers
for books, as well as embroidery for other purposes.</p>
<p>The Concordances are all bound in velvet or leather, and are
nearly all stamped with designs in gold, on much the same
plan.&nbsp; The stamps chiefly <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>used are
<i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, acorns, sprigs of oak, etc., and the amount
of ornamentation appears to depend upon the rank of the person
for whom the book was intended, and also partly upon the date
when the book was made, the earlier copies being much less
elaborate than the later volumes.</p>
<p>It is also evident that books printed in the ordinary way were
bound, or re-bound, at Gidding.&nbsp; One of the most remarkable
of which there is any authentic account is a large folio Bible,
printed by Barker, of London, in the year 1639.&nbsp; It now
belongs to the Marquis of Bute, and, as a rule, is in his library
at Cardiff; but he is most kind in allowing it to be exhibited,
and it has recently been shown at Bath, and before that at
Glasgow.&nbsp; The binding is of blue silk, elaborately decorated
with designs in gilt and silver thread, and in the centre are the
royal arms and initials C. R., which prove clearly enough for
whom the work was originally done.&nbsp; A competent authority,
one of the great professional connoisseurs, has declared the
binding to be one of the most magnificent specimens with which he
is acquainted.</p>
<p>It would ill-befit one of the ruder sex to attempt to write
critically about the needlework of the maidens of Gidding, but we
may sing their praises <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>for the skill, the industry, and the
artistic results exhibited by this branch of their daily
occupations.</p>
<p>The specimen most easily examined by any one wishing to do so,
is a cover for a dressing-case in the South Kensington Museum;
another similar piece of work was lent by a gentleman in London
to an exhibition in Dublin a few years ago; he kindly supplied
the information afterwards that he had been for many years a
collector and admirer of the Gidding needlework, and had one or
two Bible covers and some other pieces of their embroidery in his
possession.</p>
<p>A gentleman at Brighton has also a small 32mo New Testament,
printed by R. Barker, of London, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1640, which has a Gidding embroidered cover.&nbsp; The design is
a simple floral pattern worked in fine close stitches on white
silk, with a foundation of coarse canvas or holland, which was
perhaps glued on to the original boards.&nbsp; He has also a
portrait of Charles I. made in the same kind of stitch on a satin
ground, but it is not certain whether this was worked at Gidding
or not.&nbsp; A great deal of needlework of that date is wrongly
attributed to the Miss Collets.</p>
<p>An altar cloth, shown at Dublin in 1888, was also stated to be
their work, and it is extremely <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>probable that
they would have done such things, for it is mentioned &ldquo;that
they were expert with their needles, and made them serve the
altar and the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making the embroidery it would appear as if the pattern was
first drawn on paper, then cut out, and finally worked over, the
designs being for the most part in somewhat high relief.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark that, almost invariably, whenever this
embroidery is put up for sale or is exhibited, it is marked as
the work of the &ldquo;Nuns of Little Gidding.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now,
it may be said that all those who at the present day take any
interest in the life, methods, or work of Nicholas Ferrar and his
nieces, do so with feelings of admiration, and are, at least, not
to be numbered amongst their detractors.&nbsp; Yet it is curious
how the one name which helped more than anything else to work
their ruin is even now, as a rule, attached to them.&nbsp; Within
a few years of Nicholas Ferrar&rsquo;s death, some of his enemies
had a pamphlet printed and distributed &ldquo;not by hundreds,
but by thousands, and given into the hands of the parliament men
as they went daily to the House of Commons.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
title was, &ldquo;The Arminian Nunnery; a description of the
newly erected Monastical Place, or the <!-- page 27--><a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Arminian
Nunnery at Little Gidding.&rdquo;&nbsp; The books were also given
to the Puritan soldiers when near Gidding to excite them to offer
violence to the family.&nbsp; But why should the title
&ldquo;Nuns of Little Gidding&rdquo; be still the name most often
given to the Miss Colletts?&nbsp; Few persons can realize that it
is the name invented by their enemies, earnestly repudiated by
themselves, and entirely devoid of truth.</p>
<p>This may be proved in several ways.&nbsp; The house at Little
Gidding contained two <i>married</i> families, the boys and girls
all growing up together.&nbsp; The girls were purposely trained
in such domestic matters as would fit them for <i>good wives</i>,
and five of them did eventually marry.&nbsp; The two eldest
alone, having reached the ages of thirty and thirty-two, resolved
to remain unmarried, but in no way took vows.&nbsp; Nicholas
Ferrar himself was once taxed with having started a
&ldquo;nunnery,&rdquo; and replied that the name of
&ldquo;nuns&rdquo; was odious, and declared himself against such
vows of single life with great earnestness.</p>
<p>Again, a visitor to Little Gidding, describing the place and
the family, says, &ldquo;I saluted the mother and daughter <i>not
like nuns</i>, but as we salute other women.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Probably when the phrase &ldquo;Nuns of Little
Gidding&rdquo; is used at the present time, it is used in no
reproachful sense; but the name is misleading, and should be
avoided, if for no other reason, because it was invented by the
enemies of Mr. Ferrar&rsquo;s family and objected to by
themselves.</p>
<p>The family, as a matter of fact, were by no means recluses;
they went about amongst their neighbours, and were &ldquo;very
well reported of by all who knew them.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
purposely selected a quiet part of the country to live in, that
they might not be interrupted in their manifold employments; but
they appear to have been always ready to receive visitors, and to
treat them with hospitality.</p>
<p>Ferrar&rsquo;s rules for his own life were certainly somewhat
austere, and as time went on he increased its rigour, more
especially after his mother&rsquo;s death; but he never enforced
on others what he did himself, and every hour of the day appears
to have been spent usefully and happily.</p>
<p>It may be interesting to give here the opinions of some of his
more notable friends.&nbsp; Mention has already been made of the
important persons he lived amongst in his public life, and
besides them at this time there was Dr. Laud the Archbishop, <!--
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>who was so delighted to ordain &ldquo;such a man as he
never had before nor believed he ever should again.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There was Dr. Williams the Bishop of the Diocese, who often went
to Gidding and &ldquo;much magnified all that Nicholas and Mrs.
Ferrar had done;&rdquo; and not to mention others, there was
George Herbert, &ldquo;his very dear brother,&rdquo; who,
&ldquo;seeing he could not draw Gidding any nearer to him, he
would draw nearer to his brother Ferrar,&rdquo; and was
endeavouring to exchange his living merely to carry out this
wish.&nbsp; These two good men were indeed very similar in their
religious views; they &ldquo;loved and trusted one another most
entirely, and drove a large stock of Christian intelligence
together,&rdquo; and when George Herbert died, he sent his
manuscripts to Ferrar to publish or to withhold, as he thought
right.&nbsp; Chief amongst them were the poems now such
favourites in many a house.&nbsp; These, when Ferrar had many and
many a time read over, he kissed and embraced them again and
again, saying, &ldquo;they were most worthy to be in the hands
and hearts of all true Christians that feared God and loved the
Church of England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words of the Royal Friend who once or twice visited
Gidding in person stand at the <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>commencement
of this sketch, and sufficiently prove what was his estimate of
Ferrar and his works.</p>
<p>It may be easily conjectured, however, that this unusual life,
conducted by a man so well known as Ferrar, attracted a great
deal of attention&mdash;and that in the days when religious
differences prevailed to a sad extent, there were many persons
eager enough not only to find fault, but to misrepresent what was
done by this family; who, to say the least, did a great deal of
good to their poorer neighbours, and did harm to no one.&nbsp;
But a closer acquaintance with Mr. Ferrar generally dispelled the
calumnies which report had spread of him and his ways.&nbsp; And
one gentleman who went to Gidding purposely to make out their
case as bad as possible, came away full of their praises.</p>
<p>In the end, however, their enemies prevailed; for the Puritan
soldiers (about the time of King Charles&rsquo;s death) did drive
the family away, ransacked the church, plundered the house, and
destroyed many very valuable books and manuscripts, and, in fact,
everything that had been left behind in a somewhat hasty
flight.&nbsp; It is related that the organ excited their anger
more than anything, and that they relieved their feelings by <!--
page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>breaking it up, setting it on fire, and then roasting
some of Mr. Ferrar&rsquo;s sheep over it.</p>
<p>But he was not spared to see these distressful times himself,
as he died in December, 1637, having lived at Gidding about
twelve years.&nbsp; The accounts of his last illness are very
interesting, as throwing a strong light on his intensely
religious character.&nbsp; In November, 1637, on his return from
the little church, he had an attack of faintness, and never
afterwards left the house.&nbsp; He knew from the first that he
would not recover, and said to those around him, &ldquo;In former
sickness I have had a strong desire to live, and an earnestness
to pray to my God to spare me, which He hath to this day done,
when all hopes of life were past by the judgments of the most
skilful physicians; and I may further say to the Glory of His
great name, I never earnestly set myself to beg of God anything,
but He fulfilled the petition of His most unworthy servant.&nbsp;
But now and of late, I have not, nor do not find in my heart any
inclination to beg longer life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his illness he continually exhorted the family that
they should &ldquo;constantly adhere to the doctrine of the
Church of England, and to continue in the good old way;&rdquo; he
forewarned them of <!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>coming oppositions and of danger and
trouble, and urged them to shrink not to rely on God, to serve
Him with soul and body, for &ldquo;He made both, and both must
worship Him in sincerity of devotion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He will
have both inward love, and outward reverence of body and
gesture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About three days before his death, he made John Ferrar mark
out the place for his grave seven feet from the west end of the
church, leaving space for his elder brother&rsquo;s grave nearest
the church.&nbsp; He then directed that all the books of
comedies, tragedies, love-hymns, etc. (three great hampers full,
which had been locked up for many years), should be burnt on the
place marked for his grave.&nbsp; There were many hundreds in
various languages, which he had collected when a young man, but
which he had abjured as dangerous, full of idolatry, and apt to
undermine the Christian religion.</p>
<p>He retained full power of mind, and suffered no pain
throughout the whole illness, and passed away at one
o&rsquo;clock on the Sunday night, the very hour that he
constantly rose up every morning to praise God, and to pray unto
Him.</p>
<p>The family carried on all the good works in the which they had
been instructed, until they were driven away by the military
zealots of the Puritan <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>party; but in later and more peaceful
times they again assembled in the old home, though there is no
authentic account of the date, nor of the particular members of
the family that returned; but their exile does not appear to have
been of long duration, as there are entries in the register of
Gidding church, and inscriptions on brasses or tombstones, which
record events in the family history of the Ferrars and Collets
(such as baptisms and burials) as early as the year
1650&mdash;and at frequent dates afterwards.&nbsp; The Gidding
estate, which had originally been bought by old Mrs. Ferrar,
passed to her eldest son John, which is proved by his being
described on his tombstone as &ldquo;Lord of this Manor,&rdquo;
and he was succeeded by his eldest son, who was resident there in
the year 1715, as stated by Dr. Mapletoft in one of the
Concordances.</p>
<h2><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
THE CONCORDANCES OR HARMONIES.</h2>
<p>Of all the work carried on at Gidding, nothing attracted more
favourable notice at the time, than the Concordances of the Four
Evangelists, and of other portions of the Bible, and at the
present day they are also highly valued by those who possess
them, partly no doubt from a feeling of admiration for Nicholas
Ferrar himself, who designed them, but no less for their
intrinsic worth, and for the skill and industry employed in their
making.</p>
<p>Even in the books which treat of Ferrar&rsquo;s life with the
greatest exactness, reference is made to some six or seven
Harmonies, but several of these have been either lost or
destroyed, or cannot now be traced; while within the last few
years, several not mentioned in the printed biographies have been
discovered, and in the following pages much interesting matter
will be brought forward about <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>them, and the
histories of the various volumes will be given. <a
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a></p>
<p>The notoriety attaching to the Concordances can be easily
accounted for by the great interest shown in the work by King
Charles I.&nbsp; There does not appear to be any evidence to show
that the King knew Nicholas Ferrar personally, before he first
heard of the Concordance which was in daily use at Gidding.&nbsp;
The family had settled there the very year King Charles I. began
to reign, but in Ferrar&rsquo;s early life, as already stated, he
was a distinguished public servant and Member of Parliament, and
had, moreover, travelled in the suite of the King&rsquo;s sister;
so that in all probability Ferrar&rsquo;s name and character were
not unknown to him.</p>
<p>But in order to prove the real value of the work, not only as
a clever contrivance, but as an aid to religious instruction, and
to the study of the Gospel history, it is necessary to put on one
side the prestige of the royal patronage, and to give an accurate
description of some one volume.</p>
<p><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>The Harmony selected for this purpose is one of the
earliest, and least elaborate; it was made for a private friend
of the Ferrars, and is no doubt almost an exact reproduction of
the volume which was used every day by the children at Little
Gidding; for it was a part of their daily duty to repeat portions
of the Harmony to Mr. Ferrar&mdash;the book being so divided that
&ldquo;beginning still at the first day of the month, and ending
at the last day of the month, all the heads or chapters were said
over in every month&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The principle of the work was this&mdash;to make one
continuous history of all the actions and discourses of our Lord
wherever related, and this to be so arranged that the Gospel of
any one Evangelist could be read straight through from first to
last.</p>
<p>To do this without confusion was no easy task, for every word
of all four Evangelists is in the Harmony, and yet in reading
them as one connected story there is no repetition.&nbsp; The
whole of the Gospel history is divided for this purpose into one
hundred and fifty heads or chapters, each chapter containing some
special subject, and being made complete by the bringing together
the words of each Evangelist treating of that subject.</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>The following selection will show the manner in which
the subjects were chosen&mdash;</p>
<p>54.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s second going about Galilee and
sending the Apostles.</p>
<p>55.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s beheading.</p>
<p>56.&nbsp; The five loaves.</p>
<p>57.&nbsp; Jesus walking on the sea.</p>
<p>58.&nbsp; Discourse of the Bread from Heaven.</p>
<p>The method adopted throughout the work was very simple and
ingenious.&nbsp; It was this: the words of each Evangelist were
marked in the margin by a distinguishing letter, viz. St.
Matthew, by A; St. Mark, by B; St. Luke, by C.; St. John by D, so
that to read any one Gospel straight through, it was only
necessary to read all the passages marked by the same initial
letter, omitting all the others.&nbsp; But when, as often
happens, two or more writers use identical language, the words
which had been inserted before, were put in different type.&nbsp;
The body of the work was given in ordinary Roman type, but the
words which occurred a second time and were, therefore,
unnecessary for the continuous history were given in old English
lettering.</p>
<p>To make this contrivance quite clear the following directions
were written at the beginning of the concordance&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&ldquo;If you would read the Evangelical History keepe
on still from one of the marking letters to another, reading
onely that which is in the Roman letter.&nbsp; But if you would
read the Evangelists severally, then you must keepe still from
section to section in the same letter with which you begin,
reading both context and supplement, that is the Roman letter and
the Inglish letter annexed.&nbsp; Where you find any one word or
more streaked under, you are to omit it in the reading of the
context to make the clearer sence; but it is necessarily left
remaining for the reading of the Evangelist severally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To carry out this scheme in the first instance required a
complete acquaintance with the text, a clear idea of the sequence
of events, an ingenious head to plot out the work, and no small
amount of purely mechanical skill to bring it to a successful
result.</p>
<p>Nicholas Ferrar himself planned the whole Concordance, and
also superintended his nephews and nieces while they did the
work; but the system adopted may well be given in the words of
the old manuscripts.&nbsp; A large room was set apart purposely
for the work, and called &ldquo;the Concordance room,&rdquo;
which was all coloured over <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>with green,
pleasant colour, varnished for the more pleasure to their eyes,
and round the upper part of the walls were sentences written,
suggested by each person of the family and some good friends,
such as &ldquo;Glory be to God on high,&rdquo; &ldquo;Prosper
Thou, O Lord, the work of our hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;Innocency is
never better lodged than at the sign of labour,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
industrious man hath no leisure to sin; and the idle man hath no
power to avoid sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this room Mr. Ferrar &ldquo;every day spent one hour in
contriving the Concordance, and directed his nieces that attended
him in what manner they should cut the pieces out of the
Evangelist, and so, and so, to lay them together as to make and
perfect such a head or chapter.&nbsp; When they had first cut out
those pieces with their knives or scissors, then they did neatly
and exactly fit each verse that was so cut out, to be pasted down
on sheets of paper; and so artificially they performed it, that
it looked like a new kind of printing, when it was finished; so
finely were all the pieces joined together, and with great
presses for that purpose, pressed down upon the white sheets of
paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even this description scarcely conveys an <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>adequate
impression of the labour involved, for in many cases only two or
three words are taken out of one Evangelist, and added to the
account given by another.</p>
<p>And, besides the letterpress, every page is supplied with
engravings, relating to the subject in hand; and when, as often
happened, they could not find an engraving to suit exactly, parts
of different prints were combined, so as to make a suitable
illustration; and so cleverly is this &ldquo;splicing&rdquo;
carried out, that it is almost impossible to be sure where the
pictures join.</p>
<p>It will give some idea of the work if a few details are given
from the volume under consideration.&nbsp; In one place the
narrative is composed of five verses from St. Matthew, seven from
St. Mark, and four from St. Luke; but there are forty-four
separate cuttings pasted in; in another case seventeen verses
required fifty-three cuttings, and in another, fifteen verses
from the four Evangelists are inserted with thirty-four
cuttings.</p>
<p>But even when whole verses, or perhaps whole chapters, could
have been put in entire (as would occur in the discourses related
only by St. John), the Miss Collets did not save themselves
trouble if the appearance of the page could be improved.&nbsp;
<!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Some of the most attractive sheets are those where each
line has been cut out, and pasted in again in the original
sequence, but with open spacing, so as to occupy the full
page.&nbsp; In one case fifty-six lines have been treated thus,
in another fifty-eight, in another fifty-one, where each passage
might have been inserted entire.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Some instances may now be given to show the clever compilation
of connected sentences out of the accounts of different
Evangelists, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And came into the coasts of Judea, beyond
Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized, and there He
abode, and great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them
there, and as He was wont He taught them again&rdquo;
(<i>vide</i> St. Matt. xix. 1; St. John x. 40; St. Mark x.
1),</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which reads as if it was one sentence, but is in reality four
extracts from three Evangelists.</p>
<p>Again&mdash;At the supper at Bethany&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;She annointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped
His feet with her hair, and she brake the box, and poured it on
His head, and the house was filled with the <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>odour of the
ointment&rdquo; (<i>vide</i> St. John xii. 3; St. Mark xiv.
3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with
her, whereon never man sat; loose them and bring them unto
me&rdquo; (<i>vide</i> St. Matt. xxi. 2; St. Mark xi. 2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these extracts a little incident supplied by St. Mark
is introduced into the main narrative of another Evangelist, who
had not mentioned it.</p>
<p>The following also is interesting, taken from the gospels of
St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Is not this Joseph&rsquo;s
son?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s
son?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter, the son of
Mary?&rdquo; (<i>vide</i> St. Luke iv. 23; St. Matt. xiii. 55;
St. Mark vi. 3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It must not be thought that in the Concordance these extracts
are printed straight off, as they read here.&nbsp; If that were
the case, it would be open to objection that something like a new
Gospel history was being compiled; but in every case, without
exception, wherever words are introduced from another Evangelist,
a space is left, a fresh line commenced, and the distinguishing
letter placed <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>in the margin.&nbsp; One short
extract, printed as in the original, will make this quite
clear.</p>

<p>It is interesting to read these passages in the various ways
intended by the compiler, first taking the Evangelists
separately, and reading all the verses marked with the proper
letter, in both sorts of type, and then reading only the common
type, straight on, irrespective of the marking letters.</p>
<p>There is still another way in which the value of the Harmony
may be tested.&nbsp; It is of course well-known that the
historical sequence of events varies <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>greatly in
the records of the different Evangelists.&nbsp; To reconcile
these discrepancies, is often a very difficult matter, and when
combined with the other principles on which the Harmonies were
constructed must have caused a great deal of trouble, and
required much skilful adaptation.&nbsp; This part of the work can
be tested by examining some one chapter of the Authorized
Version, and we can then discover how the subjects are
treated.&nbsp; The eighth chapter of St. Luke&rsquo;s Gospel will
be a good example&mdash;</p>
<p>Vers. 1&ndash;3: &ldquo;A general account of Christ&rsquo;s
ministry and followers,&rdquo; appear on p. 102 of the
Harmony.</p>
<p>Vers. 4&ndash;15: &ldquo;Parable of the Sower, and
explanation,&rdquo; come on pp. 90&ndash;93, being composed of
the narratives of the other two Evangelists interpolated with St.
Luke&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Vers. 16&ndash;18 follow in natural order, but</p>
<p>Vers. 19&ndash;21: &ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s mother and
brethren,&rdquo; are found on p. 90, <i>before</i> the Parable of
the Sower; while</p>
<p>Vers. 22&ndash;25: &ldquo;The Storm on the Lake,&rdquo; come
still earlier in the Harmony, on p. 45.</p>
<p>Vers. 26&ndash;39: &ldquo;The herd of swine drowned,&rdquo;
following on p. 47.</p>
<p>Ver. 40.&nbsp; Stands by itself on p. 50, preceeding the
events recorded in St. Luke&rsquo;s fifth chapter.</p>
<p>Vers. 41&ndash;56: &ldquo;The raising of Jairus&rsquo;
daughter,&rdquo; come prior to the events narrated in St.
Luke&rsquo;s sixth and seventh chapters, and appear on p. 56 of
the Harmony.</p>
<p>If we may take Nicholas Ferrar&rsquo;s chronology to be
correct, it is clearly seen that the Harmony is a most valuable
aid to the study of the Gospels.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Mention has been made already of the engravings with
which the Concordances are nearly all supplied.&nbsp; On the
title-page, after describing the contents of the book, these
words always occur: &ldquo;to which are added sundry pictures,
expressing either the facts themselves or their types and
figures, or other matters appertaining thereunto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These &ldquo;pictures&rdquo; are in many cases delightfully
quaint, and are probably of considerable value, having been
collected by Nicholas Ferrar on his journey through Holland,
Germany, Italy, and Spain in the years 1613 to 1618, it being
expressly stated that they were by the best masters of that time,
and that he let nothing valuable of this sort escape him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of these prints have been cut, to make
them fit into the pages, but on others there are the names or
monograms of the artist and engraver.&nbsp; On one the date 1564
appears after the name M. Heern, invent.&nbsp; Other names
occurring are M. de Vos, Joannes Strada, Th. Galle, Phl. Galle,
Crispin Van de Passe, Brvegel, etc., etc.</p>
<p>The most usual arrangement is for the engraving to occupy the
upper half of the page, and the letterpress to be put in two
columns underneath; but occasionally there are two or three
prints in <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>the same page.&nbsp; In the copy
under consideration now, being one of the smaller volumes, there
are 138 folio pages, and about 220 prints, varying in size from
12 inches by 8, to small delicate engravings of about 2&frac12;
inches by 1 inch.</p>
<p>It would be useless to attempt to describe the pictures, so as
to give an adequate idea of their interest, but some of the
subjects may be mentioned.</p>
<p>There is a series of small engravings of the eleven Apostles
(a blank space being left in a conspicuous manner for Judas),
which represent each one with his proper emblem, and in the
background of each picture a very small illustration of the
manner of his death; for instance, St. Peter on a cross, upside
down; St. Thomas being killed by the spears of savages; St. Simon
being sawn asunder.&nbsp; Near the beginning of the volume is a
print of the Blessed Virgin with a sword piercing her body, and
surrounded by seven medallions, showing &ldquo;the seven
griefs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The parable of &ldquo;The mote and the
beam&rdquo; is quaintly depicted by two men standing near
together, one with an enormous log of wood, equal in length to a
third of his height, projecting unsupported from his own eye,
attempting to pull a small bit of straw from the eye of the
other.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>In the pictures of the Resurrection is one with a small
representation in the background of our Blessed Lord appearing to
his mother, &ldquo;who had remained at her own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Perhaps enough has now been said to give a general description
of the design of the Concordances.&nbsp; They were all made on
one plan, but no two were exactly alike.&nbsp; The actual sizes
vary considerably, and the number of pages also, from sixty-five
up to four hundred.&nbsp; By far the greater number deal with the
Gospels of the four Evangelists, but in addition to these there
are Concordances of the Books of Kings and Chronicles, and the
five Books of Moses.</p>
<p>Some slight account may now be given of all the volumes known
to be in existence at the present time.&nbsp; With the exception
of the original book, made for the instruction of the home
family, which was in daily use at Gidding, the splendid copy made
for Charles I. is the earliest of which there is any authentic
history.</p>
<p>As stated on a previous page, it was at the King&rsquo;s
urgent request that this was put in hand, and, after twelve
months&rsquo; hard work, was safely delivered to his Majesty, who
declared it to be a <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>&ldquo;rich and rare jewel, and that
there was no defect in the skill, care, and cost used in it, but
a superlative diligence in all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fine volume is now in the British Museum, having been
sent there from Windsor by George II.&nbsp; It is a large square
folio, measuring 1 foot 7 inches by I foot 2 inches, and has 287
pages, bound in leather, with a great deal of gilding on the
sides; the date on the title-page is 1635.</p>
<p>The Concordance described on pp. 36&ndash;47, and from which
the extracts were taken, has the same date on the title-page, and
the words &ldquo;done at Little Gidding&rdquo; added also.&nbsp;
It is much smaller than the Royal copy, with less than half the
number of pages.&nbsp; Its history is not quite so clear, but on
the inside of the cover appear the arms of Sir R. Cotton, who
commenced the library given by his grandson to the nation.&nbsp;
The Cottons were near neighbours of the Ferrars, and nothing is
more likely than that a lover of books should have procured one
of the earliest of the works which were rapidly becoming
famous.&nbsp; From the Cottons it passed to the family of
Bowdlers, one of whom married a daughter of the last baronet; and
the grandson of this Mr. Bowdler left the book to the father of
the writer of this sketch, now living in <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>Dorchester,
who still makes use of the book in the religious instruction of
his children.</p>
<p>The next volume made was a Harmony of the Kings and
Chronicles, the idea being originated by Charles himself.&nbsp;
He is reported to have asked for it at the very time he received
his first Harmony, saying, &ldquo;I would gladly have these
skilful persons to make me another book that might be so ordered,
that I might read these stories of Kings and Chronicles, so
interwoven by them, as if one pen had written the whole book, and
to make it a complete history; yet so ordering the matter that I
may also read them severally and apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was faithfully carried out.&nbsp; The date on the
title-page is 1637, and the book is now at the British
Museum.&nbsp; It is bound in leather, curiously gilt, rather
smaller than the first volume, and without any illustrations; but
a great deal of care was taken in its compilation, especially in
the construction of three tables relating to the contents and to
the various passages related in the Books of Kings and Chronicles
&ldquo;severally or jointly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third volume was also sent to the British Museum by George
II., as being a Little Gidding <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>work; but it
is not, strictly speaking, a Concordance, being in many ways
different to all the other Gidding works.</p>
<p>It contains merely the Acts of the Apostles and the
Revelations of St. John.&nbsp; The title-page is very fully and
curiously decorated; there is no date, and the form of title
which occurs with very little alteration in every other specimen
is also absent.</p>
<p>As the King took so much interest in these works, and valued
them so highly, it followed as a very natural result that the
young Princes should demand similar volumes for themselves;
though it is perhaps doubtful if they would have appreciated a
Concordance without any pictures.</p>
<p>Prince Charles asked the King to give him the first Harmony,
but was met with the reply &ldquo;that he might not part with it,
as he used it daily.&rdquo;&nbsp; A request was therefore sent to
Gidding that a Harmony might be prepared for the Prince, and Mr.
Ferrar being dead, the Miss Colletts and their cousin, Nicholas
Ferrar (junior), decided to complete a Concordance similar to the
first, but in four languages, English, Latin, French, and
Italian.&nbsp; The book was ready and taken to London by young
Ferrar just before Easter, 1640, <!-- page 52--><a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>which date is
affixed to the title-page.&nbsp; It was first submitted for the
King&rsquo;s approval, and, being greatly admired, was then taken
to Prince Charles at Richmond, who was intensely delighted with
his new acquisition.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a splendid volume,
containing over 200 pages, bound in green velvet, with designs of
<i>fleurs de lis</i> and sprigs of oak stamped in gold.&nbsp; The
book measured 2 feet by 1 foot 5 inches, and has &ldquo;a store
of rare pictures to delight the eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; The four
languages are arranged in four parallel columns in each page.</p>
<p>It is now in Lord Normanton&rsquo;s library at Somerley.&nbsp;
The name by which it is commonly known is
&ldquo;Monotessaron,&rdquo; which word, in Greek characters,
stands at the head of the title-page.</p>
<p>One work led on to another; and no sooner had Prince Charles
become the happy owner of an illustrated Harmony, than the young
Duke of York, who was with his brother at Richmond, must needs
want one for himself.&nbsp; Nicholas Ferrar assured him that he
should have one &ldquo;with all good speed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But how long will that be?&rdquo; said the Prince.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I pray you tell the gentlewomen at Gidding I will heartily
thank them if they will dispatch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>And, in accordance with the promise, another work was no
doubt taken in hand; but young Ferrar did not live to see it
completed, dying (as he did) at the early age of 21, within a
very few weeks of his visit to Richmond, and it is almost certain
that the Duke of York never had it given to him.&nbsp; But the
Marquis of Salisbury has at Hatfield a Harmony of the Four
Gospels, there being no record of the person for whom it was
made.&nbsp; Now the appearance of the binding and the evidence of
considerable care being taken in its preparation would lead to
the conclusion that it was originally intended for a member of
the Royal family.&nbsp; It is bound in purple velvet, sprigs of
oak and <i>fleurs de lis</i> being prominent in the decoration of
the outside.&nbsp; There is no date on the title-page, and the
earliest authority as to the owner is the book-plate of
&ldquo;the Right Hon James Cecill, 1704.&rdquo;&nbsp; In all
essential points it is identical with the copy made for Charles
I., and may be considered as the book intended for the Duke of
York.</p>
<p>The King and his suite visited Gidding in the year 1642, and
while there was shown another splendid Concordance, which he had
heard was being made for Prince Charles&rsquo; use, but which
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>was not quite ready for presentation at the time.&nbsp;
If the conjecture is correct (and there seems very little doubt
that it is so), that this is the volume now in the possession of
Captain Gaussen, of Brookmans Park&mdash;near Hatfield, it is no
wonder that several years were occupied in its completion.&nbsp;
One of the King&rsquo;s attendants remarked at the time, it was
the &ldquo;gallantest greatest book in the world,&rdquo; adding,
&ldquo;I never saw such paper before.&nbsp; I believe there is no
book of this largeness to be seen in Christendom,&rdquo; and as
the Royal party were at this time making a somewhat hasty journey
northwards on account of the disorders prevalent in the country,
the book would have been a very unsuitable addition to their
baggage.&nbsp; The writer can vouch for the fact that it is quite
as much as a man can do to carry it comfortably across a
room.&nbsp; It is magnificently bound in purple velvet, with the
usual gilt stamping, chiefly in patterns made of small
crowns.&nbsp; The measurements are 2 feet 5 inches by 1 foot 8
inches, and there are nearly 450 pages of the thickest paper,
besides which every page is profusely illustrated by the pasting
on of engravings, in the same manner as the other Gidding
works.</p>
<p>The contents of this volume are, however, different <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>to
any yet mentioned.&nbsp; The first part deals with &ldquo;the
whole law of God as it is delivered in the five Books of
Moses&rdquo; methodically distributed into three great
classes&mdash;moral, ceremonial, and political&mdash;and each of
these again subdivided into several heads, etc.&nbsp; There
follows an &ldquo;harmonical parallel between the types of the
Old Testament and the Four Evangelists&rsquo; relations of our
Lord and Saviour;&rdquo; also a &ldquo;discourse of the estate of
the Jews,&rdquo; by Dr. Jackson, &ldquo;The destruction of
Jerusalem,&rdquo; and long extracts from a work entitled
&ldquo;Moses unveiled,&rdquo; besides other matter.</p>
<p>The history of this book is very obscure.&nbsp; The account
from which the above is taken concludes with these words,
&ldquo;This book hath been preserved at Gidding, and attends the
happy hour to be delivered into the right owner&rsquo;s
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was probably written about 1653.&nbsp;
The next piece of evidence is a note made in the book itself,
that the Rev. J. Bourdillon bought it in the year 1776, but did
not then know who had compiled it.&nbsp; There is then another
break in its history, until the beginning of the nineteenth
century, when it was found walled up in a cupboard at the house
now belonging to Captain Gaussen.&nbsp; But within the last few
years the &ldquo;gallant book&rdquo; has had <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>another
interesting and dangerous experience, as its home was burnt to
the ground.&nbsp; The Concordance was, however, rescued from an
untimely fate.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar volume, but much smaller, is to be seen in
the library of St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford.&nbsp; It is
dated 1640, and contains only the &ldquo;Five Books of
Moses,&rdquo; treated in the same manner as that last
described.&nbsp; There is good reason for saying that it was made
for the Archbishop of Canterbury (Laud), and sent by him to
Oxford.&nbsp; It is illustrated throughout, and is handsomely
bound in purple velvet.</p>
<p>The late Bishop of Bath and Wells, Lord Arthur Hervey, had
another specimen of Gidding handywork.&nbsp; It is one of the
smaller volumes, containing only 66 pages, bound in leather, and
with the usual style of engravings.&nbsp; It is a Harmony of the
Four Gospels, and the different names, or book-plates, of the
various owners show that it has been in the Hervey family from
the first.&nbsp; The last line of the title page is as follows:
&ldquo;Done at Little Gidding, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1640, by Virginia Ferrar, age 12.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be
interesting to know how much was actually &ldquo;done&rdquo; by
this young lady.&nbsp; She was daughter of John Ferrar, and <!--
page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>sister of Nicholas Ferrar, junior, and was given her
name &ldquo;out of affection to the remembrance of the plantation
of Virginia, and that they might daily have the memorial of it,
as not to cease praying for the prosperity of it, and that
looking upon her they might think upon both at once.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This book is now in the possession of Lord Bristol, at Ickworth,
Bury St. Edmunds.</p>
<p>Mention has now been made of nine Concordances; and of the two
that still remain to be noticed there is this interesting fact to
be stated&mdash;that in all probability they were originally made
for members of the family, and that until a few years ago they
belonged to their descendants, who, for this very reason,
regarded them with special affection.&nbsp; They are both
Harmonies of the Four Gospels; one, dated 1640, is a small work,
and belonged to Miss Heming, of Hillingdon, a descendant of a Mr.
Mapletoft, who married one of the Miss Colletts, it is now in the
possession of Colonel Garrat, Bishop&rsquo;s Court, Exeter.&nbsp;
The other is a somewhat larger book, now in the British Museum,
recently in the possession of a Mr. Mapletoft Davis, living in
New South Wales, who also had the four volumes of the
&ldquo;Exercises of the Little Academy&rdquo; previously <!--
page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>described; all these works, and some other relics of the
Ferrars, having passed on through different branches of the
family to the late owner.&nbsp; An inscription in this
Concordance is worthy of reproduction here; it runs as follows:
&ldquo;This was the book of my honoured aunt, Mrs. Mary Collet,
compiled at Little Gidding by the direction of her uncle, Mr. N.
Ferrar, and bound, I believe, by herself.&nbsp; It was given to
me by my good and dear cousin, Mrs. Elizabeth Kestian.&nbsp; I
give it to my son, and if he dies without issue, to my daughter
Eliz. Gastrell, and I desire it may be preserved in my family as
long as may be.&nbsp; There were never above two more of the form
that I ever heard of&mdash;one was presented to Charles the First
. . . the other to King Charles II., 1660, by John Ferrar, who is
now owner of Little Gidding.&mdash;John Mapletoft, Jan.,
1715.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is certainly a curious fact that this Dr. Mapletoft should
have thought that there were only three Concordances made; and
the same mistaken idea was entertained by the owner of Colonel
Garratt&rsquo;s copy, words almost identical being written in
that work by another Dr. Mapletoft in the year 1764.&nbsp; The
John Ferrar referred to as giving the Concordance to Charles II.
must <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>have been the son of John Ferrar, brother of Nicholas;
so it is evident that the estates of Gidding were enjoyed by the
family for many years after their return from the flight caused
by the Parliamentary soldiers.</p>
<p>It is not known how long the business of making Concordances
was continued at Gidding.&nbsp; There is a letter from John
Ferrar printed, in which occurs a remark that perhaps if
&ldquo;noble or learned personages knew of them, they would
desire to have some made for their own use, or for some library,
as rarities in their kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; He also says that this
work, &ldquo;which costs much time and labour, might be an answer
to the libel that no work was done at Gidding, but all the time
spent in contemplation, as it would make the world
believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is also a request to a Dr. Basire for
two copies each of various editions and translations of the New
Testament in many different languages, so it is certain that the
work was to be carried on and developed as far as possible; and
in all probability it only ceased when the &ldquo;handy
workwomen&rdquo; went away from their united home to marry, and
devote themselves to more serious, and perhaps less pleasant,
occupations.</p>
<p>In the library of Magdalen College, Cambridge, <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>may
be seen all the materials for a Concordance similar to that at
St. John&rsquo;s, Oxford, viz. &ldquo;The Five Books of
Moses.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are two big bundles of folio sheets,
designed and plotted out for engravings and letterpress; but no
progress had been made with the work, except (curiously enough)
the title-page, which was completed, and finishes with the words,
&ldquo;Done at Little Gidding, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1641.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This method of bookmaking is not exactly in accordance with
modern ideas, but it may throw a little light on the fact that
although we know the King&rsquo;s Concordance took a whole year
to complete, there are no less than four volumes dated 1640, and
one of these is the great Harmony in four languages.&nbsp; Until
this unfinished Concordance was brought to light, it was always
difficult to explain why four works were dated the same year.</p>
<p>Before we leave this subject, a few words must be said on some
wonderful productions of the younger Nicholas Ferrar, which are
reported to have been shown to the King when &ldquo;the
Monotessaron&rdquo; was presented to Prince Charles; but they
were afterwards taken back to Gidding.</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>There was, first, &ldquo;The Gospel according to the
holy Evangelists in eight languages, viz. Hebrew, Greek, Latin,
French, Spanish, High Dutch, Saxon, and Welsh, interpreted with
Latin or English, word for word, and at one view to be seen and
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second: &ldquo;The New Testament in twenty-four
languages,&rdquo; each language written in its proper
characters;</p>
<p>Third: &ldquo;The Gospel of St. John in as many languages as
there are chapters (<i>i.e.</i> each chapter in a different
language), and interpreted word for word into Latin or
English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were not printed books, but all in the handwriting of
young Ferrar, who at the early age of twenty-one had apparently
mastered twenty-four languages.</p>
<p>This brief sketch must now be brought to a close, with the
hope that it may prove interesting to some who are unable to
peruse the longer narratives on the same subject, and which are,
indeed, very scarce at the present time.&nbsp; Should the
writer&rsquo;s hopes be fulfilled, it will surely be to them, as
it is to him, a matter of great satisfaction that at least a part
of the work carried on at Little Gidding should have been of such
a permanent <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>nature that, after 250 years, the
result can still be seen and enjoyed almost in its original
freshness, and can, indeed, be actually used for its original
purpose.</p>
<p>The workmanship of the Concordances was so excellent in every
detail, even to the paste used for their construction, that the
volumes may well last for another period of 250 years.&nbsp; And
as we turn over their pages and admire the method, the neatness,
and the skilful design therein exhibited, our thoughts are
carried back to the days and the scenes of their creation, and we
picture to ourselves more vividly the happy and religious family
which day by day met in the great Concordance room, the
well-ordered procession wending its way to the little church at
their gate, the meals in the great hall, enlivened only by the
&ldquo;historical anecdote, easy and delightful,&rdquo; the daily
repetition of David&rsquo;s Psalms, and the frequent singing to
the organ, which was tuned so low as to be a disturbance to no
one, and the words of the hymn which was frequently sung every
day&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So angels sing, and so sing we,<br />
To God on high all glory be,<br />
Let Him on earth His peace bestow,<br />
And unto men His favour show.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>But though our fancy naturally dwells on the younger and
more active members, we must by no means forget the mother of the
family, the source of all the virtues exhibited in her children
and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Living to the age of seventy-nine, Mrs. Ferrar &ldquo;at her
dying day had no infirmity and scarce any sign of old age upon
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There were few women, as all that knew
her can testify, that exceeded her in comeliness of body and
excellent beauty; of fair, modest, and sober deportment, grave in
her looks, humble in her carriage towards all people, superlative
in discretion; of few words but when she spoke (as occasion
offered itself) no woman passed her in eloquence, in judgement,
and wisdom.&nbsp; Great was her devotion to God, and her love to
God&rsquo;s word, constant her reading of the Scriptures, and her
singing of the Psalms, when she sat at work with her children and
maids about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An inscription in the great parlour, written by her in the
last year of her life, may well be given here as a fitting
conclusion to this imperfect narrative:&mdash;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
